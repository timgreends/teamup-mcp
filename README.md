## Integration Setup

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the TeamUp server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teamup": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/teamup-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TEAMUP_AUTH_MODE": "TOKEN",
        "TEAMUP_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-teamup-access-token",
        "TEAMUP_PROVIDER_ID": "your-provider-id",
        "TEAMUP_REQUEST_MODE": "provider"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT Actions Setup

1. Deploy server to Railway or another hosting service
2. In ChatGPT:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "Create new action"
   - Import schema from: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/openapi.json`
   - Authentication: None (server handles auth)
   - Save the action

### Remote Server (For ChatGPT/Web Access)

Deploy the remote server by running:
```bash
npm run start:remote
```

Or use the main start command which runs the remote server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- "List today's TeamUp events"
- "Show me customer John Doe in TeamUp"
- "Create a new TeamUp customer named Jane Smith with email jane@example.com"
- "List available TeamUp memberships"
- "Get details for TeamUp event ID 123"
- "Register customer 456 for event 789 in TeamUp"

### Available Tools

- `list_events` - List all events with optional filters
- `get_event` - Get details for a specific event
- `list_customers` - List all customers
- `get_customer` - Get details for a specific customer
- `create_customer` - Create a new customer
- `update_customer` - Update customer information
- `list_memberships` - List all available memberships
- `register_for_event` - Register a customer for an event

## Deployment Options

### Railway (Easiest)
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Built-in environment variable management
- Free tier available

### Render
- Simple deployment
- Auto-SSL
- Good for production

### Google Cloud Run
- Serverless
- Auto-scaling
- Pay per use

### Local with ngrok
- For development/testing
- `ngrok http 8080`
- Update redirect URI

## Troubleshooting

### "mode_not_allowed" Error
- This means your token doesn't have provider/admin permissions
- Solution 1: Create a new token with provider permissions in TeamUp
- Solution 2: Use OAuth mode to generate provider tokens through `/oauth-test`

### Authentication Issues
- Visit `/debug/config` to check server configuration
- Visit `/debug/test-api` to test API connectivity
- Check Railway logs for detailed error messages

### ChatGPT Connection Issues
- Ensure you're using the OpenAPI endpoint: `/openapi.json`
- Check that environment variables are set in Railway
- Verify the server is accessible at your Railway URL

## Debug Endpoints

- `/debug/config` - View current server configuration
- `/debug/test-api` - Test API connectivity
- `/oauth-test` - Generate OAuth tokens with provider permissions

## Security

- API tokens and client secrets are never exposed to end users
- All credentials are stored server-side only
- OAuth tokens are stored in memory (not persisted)
- HTTPS required for production deployments
